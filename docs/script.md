# Inspirations

<p>
  Paw-Patrol is designed to protect your pets and you. Always know where your pets are without anyone else able to do the same. Open source software allows you to know your devices are only talking to each other and gives anyone the ability to run the server themselves.
</p>

# Walk-through

<p>
  The client is built with React, *
</p>
<p>
  The server is built with Express, PostgreSQL, and Typescript and uses sendInBlue to send emails to users if their pet leaves their perimeter.

# Further Development

<p>
  In the future we would like to integrate Twilio so the user can also receive an SMS, replace bootstrap with custom scss, move to a smaller tracking device, and dockerize the software to allow easier deployment for self-hosting
